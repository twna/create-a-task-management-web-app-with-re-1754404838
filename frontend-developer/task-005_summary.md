To implement the "add task" functionality for a to-do application, we'll need to create a JavaScript function that can take a task description as input and add it to an array of tasks. We'll also need to update the user interface to display the new task.

Here's a simple implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:


### Summary:

The code above provides a simple HTML page with an input field for new tasks and a button to add the task to the list. The `addTask` function is called when the button is clicked. This function retrieves the task description from the input field, checks if it's not empty, and then adds it to the `tasks` array. It also creates a new list item (`<li>`) with the task description and appends it to the unordered list (`<ul>`). Finally, it clears the input field so that a new task can be entered.

### Reasoning:

The approach taken here is straightforward and suitable for a simple to-do list application. We use an array to store the tasks, which allows us to easily add new items. The UI is updated dynamically by creating new elements and appending them to the DOM. This method avoids the need for page reloads and provides a smooth user experience. The code is kept simple for clarity and ease of understanding, which is appropriate for a basic to-do list application.
