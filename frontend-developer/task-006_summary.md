Certainly! Below are the HTML and JavaScript code snippets for a basic user authentication system, including a login form and a signup form. Note that these forms are for frontend only and do not include backend integration or form submission logic.



### Summary:
The provided code includes two forms: one for login and one for signup. Each form has its own HTML structure and JavaScript event listeners for form submission. The JavaScript code prevents the default form submission and logs the input values to the console. It also includes a check to ensure that the passwords match in the signup form.

### JSON Checklist:

### Reasoning:
The approach taken is to provide a simple and clear structure for the forms, ensuring that they are accessible and easy to use. The JavaScript event listeners are set up to handle form submissions and provide basic validation (such as password matching on signup). This code is intended to be a starting point and does not include actual authentication logic, which would typically involve sending a request to a backend server and handling the response.
