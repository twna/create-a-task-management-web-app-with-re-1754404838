To implement user authentication logic, we need to consider several aspects such as user registration, password hashing, token generation, and verification. For this example, I'll use Python with Flask and its extensions Flask-Login for session management and Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing. I'll also use itsdangerous for token generation for things like password reset functionality.

Here's a simplified version of the user authentication logic:


Summary:
- The `/register` endpoint allows new users to register by providing a username and password. The password is hashed before being stored.
- The `/login` endpoint authenticates users by their username and password.
- The `/logout` endpoint logs out the current user.
- The `/reset-password` endpoint generates a password reset token for the user.
- The `/reset-password/confirm` endpoint allows users to reset their password using the token they received.

JSON Checklist:


The approach taken here is a common pattern for user authentication in web applications. Passwords are never stored in plain text, and Flask-Login manages user sessions securely. The itsdangerous library is used to generate secure tokens for password resets, which expire after a certain period for security reasons.
