To create a database schema for users, we need to define the structure of the `users` table including the necessary fields that will store user information. Here's a basic example of a SQL schema for a `users` table in a relational database such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite:


### Summary:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each user, typically an auto-incrementing integer or a UUID.
- `username`: A unique username for the user.
- `email`: The user's email address, which is also unique.
- `password_hash`: A hash of the user's password for secure storage.
- `first_name`: The user's first name.
- `last_name`: The user's last name.
- `created_at`: A timestamp for when the user was created.
- `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the user's information was last updated.

This schema includes the essential fields for a user management system. The `password_hash` field is intended to store a hashed version of the user's password, which is a security best practice. The `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are automatically managed by the database to track when records are created and last modified.

### JSON Checklist:


The approach taken ensures that the user data is stored securely and efficiently, with considerations for uniqueness and data integrity. The schema can be extended with additional fields as needed, such as roles or permissions, depending on the requirements of the application.
