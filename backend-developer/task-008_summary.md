To create a database schema for tasks, we need to define the structure of the database in terms of tables, columns, and relationships between them. Here's a simple schema for a task management system:


### Summary:
The schema consists of two tables:

1. `Users`: This table stores user information. Each user has a unique `UserID`, a `Username`, an `Email`, and a `PasswordHash`. The `CreatedAt` field records when the user was created.

2. `Tasks`: This table stores tasks. Each task has a unique `TaskID`, a `UserID` that references the `Users` table to associate the task with a user, a `Title`, an optional `Description`, a `Priority` level, a `Status`, an optional `DueDate`, and timestamps for `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt`.

The `Tasks` table has a foreign key constraint on `UserID` to ensure referential integrity with the `Users` table.

### JSON Checklist:

The reasoning for this approach is to create a normalized database schema that can efficiently store and retrieve user and task data. The use of `ENUM` for `Priority` and `Status` fields restricts the values to a predefined list, ensuring data integrity. The `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` fields automatically record the creation and last update times for each record. The `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute for primary keys ensures that each record has a unique identifier. The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint maintains the relationship between users and their tasks.
