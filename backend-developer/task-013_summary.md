To set up routes for user authentication, we'll need to define endpoints for various authentication-related actions such as sign up, sign in, sign out, and possibly for password reset or account verification. Below is an example of how you might set up these routes using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework.


In this code snippet, we're assuming that there's an `authController` module that exports functions for handling each of these actions. Each route is associated with an HTTP method (`POST` in this case) and a controller function that will handle the request.

Here's a plain-text summary of the routes:

- `POST /signup`: Endpoint for user registration.
- `POST /signin`: Endpoint for user login.
- `POST /signout`: Endpoint for user logout.
- `POST /password-reset-request`: Endpoint to request a password reset.
- `POST /password-reset`: Endpoint to reset the password using a token or code.
- `POST /verify-account`: Endpoint to verify a user's account, typically after signup.

And here's the JSON checklist block for the routes:


The reasoning behind using `POST` for these routes is that they all involve creating or updating resources (sessions, password reset tokens, verification tokens) and/or changing the state of the system, which aligns with the semantics of the `POST` method. Additionally, `POST` requests do not have parameters appended to the URL, which is more secure for sensitive information like passwords.
