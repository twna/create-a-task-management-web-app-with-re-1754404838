To implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a task management system, we need to define the data structure for a task and the functions that will handle these operations. Below is a simple example using Python with a dictionary to store tasks. Each task has an ID, a title, and a description.


Summary:
- `create_task` function creates a new task with a unique ID, title, and description.
- `read_task` function retrieves a task by its ID.
- `update_task` function updates the title and/or description of an existing task by its ID.
- `delete_task` function removes a task by its ID.

Here is a JSON checklist block for the CRUD operations:


The reasoning for this approach is to provide a simple in-memory representation of tasks with unique identifiers. This allows for basic CRUD operations without the need for a database or external storage. This example is suitable for demonstration purposes or a small-scale application. For a production environment, you would typically use a database and include error handling, validation, and possibly authentication and authorization mechanisms.
