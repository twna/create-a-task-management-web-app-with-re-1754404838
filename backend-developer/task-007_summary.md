To set up a Node.js server with Express, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize a new Node.js project.
2. Install Express.
3. Create a simple server with Express.
4. Start the server.

Below is the code that accomplishes these tasks:


To run this server, you would save the code to a file (e.g., `server.js`) and execute it with Node.js by running `node server.js` in your terminal.

**Summary:**
The provided code initializes a new Express application, defines a route for the root URL that responds with "Hello, World!", and starts the server listening on a specified port.

**Reasoning for Approach:**
The approach taken is standard for setting up a basic Express server. It involves initializing a Node.js project with a `package.json` file, installing necessary dependencies (in this case, Express), setting up routing to handle HTTP requests, and starting the server to listen for incoming connections on a specified port. This setup is minimal and serves as a starting point for more complex applications.
