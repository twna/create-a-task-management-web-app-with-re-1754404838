To set up routes for task operations in a backend application, you would typically use a web framework that allows you to define URL patterns and associate them with specific functions or methods that handle HTTP requests. Below is an example of how you might set up these routes in a Node.js application using the Express framework.


In this example, we have defined five routes for different task operations:

1. `GET /tasks` - Retrieve all tasks.
2. `GET /tasks/:id` - Retrieve a specific task by its ID.
3. `POST /tasks` - Create a new task.
4. `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update an existing task by its ID.
5. `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task by its ID.

Each route is associated with a method in the `taskController`, which contains the logic for handling the request and response.

Here's a plain-text summary of the routes:

- The `GET /tasks` route is used to fetch all tasks.
- The `GET /tasks/:id` route is used to fetch a single task by its unique identifier.
- The `POST /tasks` route is used to create a new task.
- The `PUT /tasks/:id` route is used to update an existing task identified by its unique identifier.
- The `DELETE /tasks/:id` route is used to delete an existing task identified by its unique identifier.

The reasoning for this approach is to follow RESTful principles, which provide a clear and intuitive way to manage resources (in this case, tasks) via HTTP methods. Each route corresponds to a standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation.

Here's the output in a JSON checklist block:


This JSON object provides a checklist of the routes that have been implemented, including the HTTP method, the path, a description of the route, and a flag indicating that the route has been implemented.
